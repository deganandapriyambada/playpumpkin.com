**its a lot!** and definitely will help grinding especially for slot machine, valhalla and las noches.

    Hence, it is really important to collect all of the outfit (grey,blue and orange)

&mdash; however, collecting outfit for wardrobe collections is a journey, it may take weeks or even months. 

# Collection Priotization

Unlike the collection lvl bonus, each outfit collection will give different status bonus.

For example

[Some outfit give bonus on all status and some only give str and statima](/assets/images/pockieninja/outfit3.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

as shown on above image, each outfit has different stats bonus.

    it is important to prioritize the outfit collection. Prioritize the outfit that give most benefit to the character build.

if the character is built for speed dodge breaker, then should prioritize collecting outfit with agility and strength bonus.
