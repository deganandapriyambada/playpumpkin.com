stamina or energy will be recovered everyday after daily reset (usually arround 5 AM server time, depend on the server policy)

for non VIP user, 150 stamina will be recovered while for VIP user, total 200 stamina will be recovered.

below is the simulation result of fully conume 180 stamina for slot machine. The objetive of this simulation is to find out how many S rank scroll and seal breaker that can be obtained per 180 stamina

# Why is benchmarking 180 stamina for S rank and seal breaker drop rate?

180 stamina is the total amount of recoverable stamina or energy that can be recovered using food with following breakdown:

1. sakura potion - give 20 stamina (max 3 per day)
2. shizune potion - give 30 stamina (max 3 per day)
3. toad arcanum - give 10 stamina (max 3 per day)

in total it could recover 180 stamina

    (20*3) + (30*3) + 30 = 180 stamina/energy.

# Why A Rank Scroll is Not Observed?

evethough opening an A rank scroll only cost 3 seal breaker, but the drop rate of lvl 10 stone bag, 250K stone bag and gift card are lower compared to the s-rank scroll.

moreover A rank scroll doenst have the jackpot. Which is mystic outfit jar (best outfit as of now).

    Hence, it is not recommended to open A rank scroll over S Rank scroll

&mdash; it is advised to only open S rank scroll!

as shown on above images, before using all the 180 stamina, there are :

- 463 seal breaker scroll
- 117 S Rank seal breaker

# Simulation Condition (Character Status)

## Character Battle Status

[Character Status](/assets/images/pockieninja/simulation3.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

lvl 70 character is used with 1.3K dodge, 1K break and 3K+ attack. Moreover, the equiped skills is geared toward surviveability and designed to withstand chakra blade(incase the chakra is absorbed till empty)

&mdash; Theoritically this should guarantee **100% win rate or if not >= 95%**

## Drop Rate Buff

the character is equiped with two drop rate buff

1. 20% drop rate buff from the bloodline
2. 15% drop rate buff from pet skill

so in total, it has 35% more drop rate than a normal character without any drop rate buff.

# Simulation Result

below is the simulation result after consuming all 180 stamina for slot machine lvl 66

[Stamina is fully empty and the amount of seal breaker and s-rank scroll is increased on the inventory](/assets/images/pockieninja/simulation1.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

as you may see below, this is the amount of s rank scroll and seal breaker gained over 180 energy/stamina.

| Item | n Item at Start | n item at end | n Gains |
|------|------|------|------|
| Seal Breaker | 463 | 568 | 105 |
| S-rank Scroll  | 117 | 159 | 42 |

so the summary are :

- 105 Seal breaker per 180 stamina
- 42 S-Rank Scroll per 180 stamina
- average actual drop rate of seal breaker is +- 58%
- average actual drop rate of S-Rank scroll is +- 23%
