Status buff is different with bonus status that can be obtained from equipment status, pet passive skills, equipment refinement/enhancement/inscribe status.

there are two kid of buff that can be consumed to **increase character status/power**. these buff can be obtained via following way :

| No | Item | Function/Purpose | Source | 
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Angelic/guardian Blessing Buff | increase atk, speed, stamine, dodge, break | angel city |
| 2 | Buff Food |can incrase atk,dodge,stamina and break | angel city |

# Get angelic/guardian blessing buff

    Angelic/guardian blessing has duration of 1 hour.

go to the angel city and visit dice of fate building. 

pay 10K stones to get 10 chance to roll a dices. at specific dice combition, it will give either anglic/guardian/demon buff.

angeling buff/angeling blessing will give :

- up to 4 block
- up to 4 dodge
- up to 7 hit
- up to 7 piece
- up to 6 const
- up to 6 break
- up to 7 defense

demon buff will reduce the character stats, in other hand angelic buff will increase the character status

    no need to worry if getting demonic buff, it can be easily replaced with angelic/guardian buff

adding re-reroll attempt is super easy, only need to pay 10K stones again. it can be spammed. 

&mdash; it is recommended to obtain angelic/guardian blessing to increase character atk, stamina,speed,hp and break before going into :

1. slot machine (if only if struggled)
2. valhalla (if only if struggled)
3. las nochles (highly recommended)
4. tailed beast (not recommended, as lvl 71 beast is really hard to beat, consuming food will be a waste as it wont increase the chance of beating lvl 71 tailed beast)

it will help adding more damage/power!.

# Food Buff to increase atk,stamina,hp,dodge

    Food buff has durationb of 1 hour

there are various food buff that can increase character status temporarily.

as of now, there is only one way to obtain this food which is through **tsunade pub** (yes its gacha).

because the chance to get food is kind of low/medium, it is recommended to only food buff at special occassion.

generally its suggested to use food buff to climb las nochles floor as it will give huge amount of exp depending on the number of floor to reach maximum level.

higher floor giving higher exp bonuses.

&mdash; other than las nochles climb, in our opinion, food should be used otherwise it will be a waste.

## Food buff list and its effect
