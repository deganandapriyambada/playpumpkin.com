[greedy skills can be discovered or obtained on the thirds skill bar a.k.a passive skill slot](/assets/images/pockieninja/droprate1.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

greedy pet skill can be obtained on pet kennel by discovering new skill for pet.

it has **low chance to obtain the skill**, be patient and keep discovering the passive skills until the greedy skill is obtained.

    all pet type (dragon,plant,channeling,etc) can get greedy skill.

greedy skill can increase 20% drop rate and it is stacked with the blood line drop rate buff (only 1 bloodlimit drop boost that can be stacked)
