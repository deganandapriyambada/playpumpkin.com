## Outfit Recommendation

recommended outfit: orange outfit with **agility** as the main stats (with highest agility multipier = lowest n number of agility to increase 1% speed).

below are some outfit recommendation to start pockie ninja journey by beating sm lvl 16 !

### 4th Hokage

Multipier: for every 10 agility it increase 1% speed 

4th hokage is recomemnded due to the element (wind) attribute. On low stages slot machine, quick steps (wind based skill/jutsu) is crucial skill.

### Itachi Uciha

Multipier: for every 10 agility it increase 1% speed

Uchiha itachi has illusion attribute with higher strength multipier(more damage). However, it is not really benefical to have illusion skill compared to wind skill at this stage. more damage is better than surviveability on low lvl slot machine.
