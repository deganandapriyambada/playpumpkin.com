during old school orange equipment(armor/weapon) with four lines of bonus stats or usually called as 4s can be obtained only through synthesis.

it use following formula

| Target Equipment | Main Item | Catalyst |  
|----|----------|--------|
| 1s (grey equipment) | 0s | 0s + 0s | 
| 2s (green equipment) | 1s | 1s + 1s | 
| 3s (purple equipment) | 2s | 2s + 2s | 
| 4s (orange/gold equipment) | 3s | 3s + 3s | 

&mdash; however, on modern pockie ninja those method to retrieve 2s/3s/4s equipment is no longer be used as its **takes time** to do the synthesis all the way from 1s to 4s.

on the modern pockie ninja, there is an item called carving blade which can be obtained by beating **slot machine**.

- 1s equipment + carving blade = **2s equipment**
- 2s equipment + carving blade = **3s equipment**
- 3s equipment + carving blade = **4s equipment**

to use carving blade, open bag and choose compose.

then select **impress tab** (the most right tab)

    dont worry, carving blade is easy to drop from slot machine. No need to stress out crafting 4s from sythesis.

# Equipment Strategy: Use Valhalla equipment instead of standard item shop equipment

[4s equipment from itemshop is no longer a meta.](/assets/images/pockieninja/4s-4.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

as getting 4s equipment nowdays is easy, it is recommended to not use standard equipment that can be obtained on item shop

character should be using 4s equipment fromv valhalla as it is giving additional bonus status from the usual four line bonus stats.

equipment dropped from valhalla then can be impressed using carving blade to reach 4s (four bonus line)
