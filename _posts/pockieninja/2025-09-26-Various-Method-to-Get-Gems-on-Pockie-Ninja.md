# How to obtain gems.

there are three way to obtain gems

1. through synthesis
2. beat soul demon
3. las nocles
4. open s-rank secret technique scroll.

## Synthesizing gems

gems is really easy to get using synthesis method.
below combination will give high chance to obtain a gems.

    hand grenade + 1s + 1s

note: 1s is equipment with one line bonus stats, usually the equipment overlay color is green.

[gem synthesis using hand grenade and 1s equipment. it can also become 1s equipment](/assets/images/pockieninja/gem2.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

if the synthesis is failed(not become a gem), it will become 1s equipment which can be used as material to re-synthesis into gem.

however, the gems type whether it is strength,agility,max hp, hp% or stamina is pure rng or random.

fortunately, getting the synthesis material for gems is pretty easy. it can be spamable and just keep synthesizing until getting the desired gems.

## Beat Soul Demon

[Soul demon can also gems, but it has low chance. its recommended to increase the character drop rate.](/assets/images/pockieninja/gem3.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

soul demon (any type or lvl) can also drops gems. Similar with synthesizing approach, soul demon gems drop is also random.

it is recommended to farm gems via soul demon as it can also drop **hand grenande.** The main material to synthesize gems.

## Las nochles

[Gem treasure jar can also be dropped on las nochles on any level. it has low chance](/assets/images/pockieninja/gem5.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

las nochles can also drop **gem treasure jar**. the rate is unknown (depend on the server policy)

gem jar can drop various gems with various level. If lucky enough it can drop **lvl 70 gems!**

## S-Rank secret scroll

[Gem treasure jar has 9.3% drop rate on s-rank technique scroll](/assets/images/pockieninja/gem4.jpg){: .center-image-2 }

S-rank secret scroll is the sources of every growth items including **gems treasure jar**. it can also obtaineable through s-rank secret scroll with 9.3% rate

9.3% is quite generous. every 100 of s rank secret technique scroll it can drop up to 9 gem treasure jar.
