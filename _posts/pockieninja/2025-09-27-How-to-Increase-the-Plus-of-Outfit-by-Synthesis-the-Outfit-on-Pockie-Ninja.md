outfit is one important character growth factor. Rarity and the amount of refinement (number for plus) will significantly impact the bonus status.

it is recommended to increase the plus of an outfit until the maximum lvl (capped to the character level)

    character lvl 66 can only wear up to +22 outfit.

every 3 level, the number of outfit refinement (the plus number) is increased by 1

&mdash; do not over refine the outfit, otherwise it can't weared by the character as there is level limit or cap.

# Keep non main outfit so maximum +2

if the outfit is planned to be deposited into collections (wardrobe collections), do not over refine it. Keep maximum +2 as the minimum refine level for collections is +2.

only perform maximum refine on main outfit for the character build.

# Increase Outfit Refinement Level

need minimum 3 copy of identifcal outfit to execute the outfit refinement.

to increase +0 outfit into +1 outfit, the outfit need to be synthesized with **identical outfit** (exactly same outfit).

below is the formula to refine an outfit to +1

    outfit+0 + same outfit + same outfit = outfit +1

[outfit refine from +1 to +2, it has 88% chance](/assets/images/pockieninja/refineoutfit4.jpg){: .center-image-2 }


to refine outfit into +2

    outfit+1 + same outfit + same outfit = outfit +2

the higher refinment the **lower is the chance**. 

keep it until reach maximum refinement level (mind the outfit level requirement cap).

refinement can be applied to any outfit (not only orange/red/grey/blue) it can also be applied to purple outfit

## Refinement via Purifying stone (100% guarantee success refinemnet)

purifying stones can be obtained on **tsunade pub.** However, the drop chance is super low.

is is recommended to only use puriying stones for **highest grade outfit** (mystic outfit or above) as it really hard to get the duplicate.

to use purifying stones the formula is

    outfit + purifying stones + purifying stone = 100% chance to +1 the outfit level
