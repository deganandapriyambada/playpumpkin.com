# Why stamina is important

Beating slot machine will give tons of useful item from stones, s rank scroll, seal breaker, blood line material until equipment fodder.

2. stamina recovery item

# Getting VIP 

VIP will give maximum stamina pool. instead of getting 150 stamina per day, WIP characters or users will now get 200 stamina perday.

&mdash; it is equal to 50 additional slot machine attempt per day!.

50 slot machine on lvl 66 roughly can give the character 450K stones, +- 2 S Rank Scroll and 15% more blood line material! **per day**. Quite a lot.

## How to get VIP
