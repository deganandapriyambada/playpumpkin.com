# The Importance of Beating High Level Slot Machine

&mdash; Beating slot machine on pockie ninja is a must because it **drop useful material for accelerating the character lvl, money/gold and power**.

take a look on below mapping to understand the possible item drop from slot machine and its use.

| No | Item | Use | Description |
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Seal Breaker | Open S-rank Scroll or A Rank Scroll | need 5 seal breaker to open one S rank scroll <br > and  3 seal breaker to open A rank scroll |
| 2 | S/A Rank Scroll | To receive different random item | Noteable imporatant item from scroll : <br /> Jackpot: mystic pot (top tier costume with str/agi/stam 6) <br /> Daily needs : Money Bag, need lot of gold/money to refresh the money tree/zankupato for bankai update <br /> Certificate bag (300/100). used for refine, add socket/slot to equipment or gacha on tsunade pub(jackpot is kurodo/purify stone or pheonix) |
| 3 | Bloodline material  | tons of bankai item needed to open new bloodline | SM56 will drop bloodline material for BL lvl 50-56 <br /> SM66 will drop bloodline material for BL lvl 60++ <br /> Higher lvl bloodline give higher status bonus and special effect compared to low lvl bloodline |

Key points :

1. to stay competitive on pockie ninja, **daily SM is needed** (it is generally recommended to consume all available stamina for SM) and if possible beat the highest lvl slot machine to get better rewards especially for the blood line material.
2. **farming low lvl slot machine will hinder the character progress** and eventually will leave behind with other players. eg: current character lvl is 61 but only able to farm SM56, meaning it cant obtain blood line material for BL60. Those player will out from the competition.

# Strategy to Beat Slot Machine

each slot machine lvl have its own challenges, below is the references strategies to beat slot machine for each level.

&mdash; Generally speaking, **Slot machine is just status check gate**. as long as the character has **enough attack, dodge and speed** it will able to clear out the stages even with only 1 player.

above rule is applied for all SM level (31 to 66). However, it also important to set the right skills.

## Costume Selection

at this stage (SM 61 and SM66), high quality outfit need to be refined to the max.

for **speed-dodge-breaker** build there are two outfit recommendation

1. Mugetsu ichigo, 8/7 stength and agility growth (water attribute)
2. Chakra Naturo, 7/8 tength and agility growth (wind attribute)

just choose based on the preferences, both will works as SM66 opponets average speed is only 3.86, generally not require much agility growth.

However, **mugetsu ichigo is preferred as it has water attribute**. can increase the chance to activate prayer skill (barrier that can nullify all incoming damage, really useful for all content not just slot machine)

## Strategy to Battle Slot Machine Lvl 61 (Solo)

SM lvl 61 where the real hell is began due to:

1. there is an opponents that has 1.3K++ dodge (ino/equivalent)
2. there is an opponents with 1.6K++ break (shikamaru/equivalent)
3. there is an opponents with damage reflection (gaara/equivalent)
4. most of opponent has 800+ attack and it hurts!

So in addition of high speed stats, the character should already incorporate **dodge**!

stats jumped like a rocket into following schema

| No | Opponent Status | Avg Value | Character Target Stats | 
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Speed | 3.86 | Speed > 4.0 |
| 2 | Def | 2K ~ 3K | Break >800 <br /> Atk: > 2K |
| 3 | Atk | 700 ~ 1K | Dodge> 800 |

## Skill Recommendation 

1. Quick Step
2. Chidori
3. Thunder fall
4. Greath Strength
5. Assassinate
6. **Sexy justu (Mandatory)** as some opponents already have high dodge. No need to raise hit.
7. **Prayer(Mandatory)** because opponents atk already high and the prayer's barrier will help nullify the damage

below is the sample build to beat SM lvl 61

## Strategy to Battle Slot Machine Lvl 66 (Solo)

same strategy as SM lvl61, however the opponents stats are growing. Hence, the character need 2.8K++ attack with 1.2K ++ dodge, out speed the opponents and at least **8% life steal** to counter the gaara's reflection. 

Slot machine lvl 66 stats

| No | Opponent Status | Avg Value | Character Taget Stats | 
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Speed | 3.86 | Speed > 4.0 |
| 2 | Def | 2K ~ 3K | Break >800 <br /> Atk: > 2.8K++ |
| 3 | Atk | 700 ~ 1K | Dodge> 1.2K |

## Skills to beat SM Lvl66

    it is recommended to avoid skills with chakra. 

Left out of thunderfall,prayer,waterfall, assassinate (for life steal) and resurrection because opponents on SM lvl 66 can drain a lot of chakra if they use chakra blades.

&mdash; need to balance out surviveability and attack (the character should already have high atk/2.8K++, even normal atk can deal 1K+ pure damage, no need to relies on powerful atk skill)

skillset :

1. prayer (to survive!)
2. thundefall(to stun)
3. Eight triagram plam(as main atk incase the opponents abosrb all the chakra)
4. great strength (to stun)
5. assassinate (for life steal)
6. substituion technique
7. sexy jutsu, to counter high dodge (kakashi notebook, get via guild picnic)
8. giant waterfall, to stun opponents. very effective as most of the opponents use buff skill (kakashi notebook, get via guild picnic)
