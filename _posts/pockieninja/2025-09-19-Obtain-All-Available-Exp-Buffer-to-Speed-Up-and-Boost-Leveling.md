It is really imporatnt to lvl up faster on pockie ninja as some of the power upgrade are locked under
lvl gate especially during the new server openings.

| No | Power Upgrade | Minimum Lvl | Power Upgrade |
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Blood Limit (initial)  | 20 | High |
| 2 | Clan (Gardening, Protection, Picnic Reward, Training)  | 40 | Astronomical |
| 3 | Bankai  | 40 | High |
| 4  | Full Skill  | 40 | Low |
| 5  | Advanced Blood Limit <br /> (higher lvl BL has better stats and new effect)  | 20 ~ 100 | Astronomical |
| 6  | Valhalla (better equipment)  | 11 ~ 76 | High |
| 7  | Slot Machine (to obtain hand granade, <br /> seal scroll, s rank scroll)  | 11 ~ 76 | High |

&mdash; Hence, based on above power spike table which are locked behind character lvl, it is really important to **lvl as fast as possible.** to stay competitive.
